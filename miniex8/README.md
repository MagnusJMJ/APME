### The Program
In the beginning, I wanted to base this mini-exercise on Daniel Shiffman's coding challenge
involving fractal trees. However, I ended up making this instead - a simple game of Rock,
Paper, Scissors, played against the computer. I made the switch mainly because I thought
it would be an interesting thing to code, and also because it is considerably easier
to illustrate in a flowchart than a recursively defined tree...

### The challenges
While I was still working with the fractal tree script, it really dawned on me just how
difficult it can be to work with other people's code. Instead of adding functionality to
the script, I ended up spending most of my time making edits to make the code more like
_"how I would've written it"._ In addition, I had considerable issues not frying my brain
like a wet electrical circuit trying to wrap my head around recursive functions...

### The flowchart
_Coming soon!_
