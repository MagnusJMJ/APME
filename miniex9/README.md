### Wolfram Alpha | Short Answer API

NB! The Professor is good at questions with short, factual answers, like "How long is the Thames?" or "How much money is
Apple worth?" - others, not so much. Some questions produce weird answers, others straight up don't work. Experiment!
Also, there are no other files in this directory, but fret not! All you need is in index.html. :) The program should run
fine without any bells and whistles, but if it doesn't, you're shit out of luck. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is a strange
beast and I don't know how to tame it.

## The API
For this mini-exercise, I did some virtual window shopping, and decided to try and implement Wolfram Alpha's API.
Wolfram Alpha is (in their own words) *a computational knowledge engine* that interprets the questions you ask,
answers them directly, and provides supplementary information on the subject. Most of the time, it is also Wolfram
Alpha that does the number crunching if you ask your iPhone to solve a mathematical equation, or similarly complex
query.

The diversity and complexity of the output generated by Wolfram Alpha, however, makes it difficult to implement it
in a simple template. Depending on what you ask (and how you ask) Wolfram Alpha will reply with charts, plain text,
images, and even sound files. Thankfully, there are several different API's to choose from on their website. The
one I chose is probably the most different from the "real" Wolfram Alpha, as it strictly responds with short, plain-
text answers in the XML format (Xtensible Markup Language), which is very similar to JSON. The "full" API will respond
with information-rich objects, including text, tables and images, similar to what you would get by using Wolfram Alpha
on its own website. I chose this API because Wolfram Alpha is an application that I already know and love, and I thought
it would be interesting to work with its API.

## The Process of Acquiring and using data
Deciding what to do with the output data was a pretty central concern with this program, as the full Wolfram Alpha API is
fairly unpredictable in what type of output it will produce. Smoothly integrating image, text and charts dynamically based
on what the API ships in its response would be an interesting fight to pick, but I had plenty of trouble outside of this issue,
and decided it was better left as a personal project. Luckily, Wolfram Alpha offers a range of different API's, and one I used -
the Short Answers API - is focused on delivering clear, concise answers in plain text, making it very straight-forward to
implement. A drawback of the Short Answers API is that it does not (as far as I know) support several response formats (which
the full API does). The Full API can deliver responses in JSON, HTML, or XML, but the Short Answers API is limited to XML.
XML is similar to JSON, but has a slighty different syntax, meaning it won't parse in p5.js' `loadJSON()` or `JSON.parse()`.
Luckily, Javascript has a built-in `XMLHttpRequest` object for precisely this purpose. With this technique, (commonly called AJAX)
you simply create a new `XMLHttpRequest`-object, specify the method of the request you want to make, and the URL/path you want
to address, like so:
```
var myVar = new XMLHttpRequest;
myVar.open('GET', urlGoesHere);
myVar.send();
```

## The Aesthetics of Big Data
While the influence of Big Data is easy to miss on the surface, it is still very much a cornerstone of what Wolfram Alpha is,
because the very point of Wolfram Alpha is its ability to summon a large amount of relevant data, based on its own interpretation
of what it is you want, which *in turn* is based on large amounts of data from all the other searches Wolfram Alpha digests. It
also distinguishes itself by making sense of huge amounts of data and distilling that into its search results. I think that's
also what's at the core of the aesthetics of Big Data in a broader scope. You can compare it with the nature of pseudo-randomness,
which, by now, is a recurring theme in our literature in both Aesthetic Programming and Software Studies. pseudo-randomness
*appears* random and unbiased, but all it takes is a large enough sample size, and eventually you start to see discernable
patterns. [This web page](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/compare.html) actually contains a script that will let you run
an array "shuffling" function in JavaScript and visualize statistical discrepancies to see how "truly random" it is. This
might seem like a digression, but it is in the same way (I postulate) that Big Data seems only to make sense once the sample-
size is big enough. The magic of Big Data is that seemingly completely unrelated and random statistics begin to form a coherent
picture if the perspective is wide enough. On a final note, Wolfram Alpha probably isn't the most ideal API to implement if you
want to make a point about Big Data, as there are (from what I've gathered) many API's that deal more directly with statistics
and analysis, but Wolfram Alpha nonetheless is a great example of the sophisticated tools we can make with Big Data.
