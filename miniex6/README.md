Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton first created by British mathematician John Conway in 1970.
The grid consists of cells, and each cell has two possible states - alive and dead. The intial pattern of
dead and living cells is created by the user, but when the 'simulation' is started, the cells evolve
on their own, according to these four simple laws:

### The Rules
 * Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
 * Any live cell with less than two live neighbours dies, as if by loneliness.
 * Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives to the next generation.
 * Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours comes alive, as if by reproduction.
Though the rules are simple, they can generate complex patterns. Try to experiment with different patterns and shapes!

### Generativity
ahhhhh
